Welcome to **Mini Projects**, a collection of my small coding experiments, fun projects, and learning exercises.  
This repository is my personal playground for trying out ideas, exploring new concepts, and practicing programming.

### 🔐 Cipher
- **Path**: [`cipher/`](cipher/)
- A simple Caesar-style cipher that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using a numeric key.  
- Example usage:
```bash
./cipher -e "hello" 3   # Encrypt
./cipher -d "khoor" 3   # Decrypt
